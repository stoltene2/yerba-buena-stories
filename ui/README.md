You'll need grunt, ruby, and compass to get things started.

Install grunt-cli & bower globally (using -g switch)
  sudo npm install -g grunt-cli bower

Install grunt locally (in this directory) 
  npm install grunt

Install compass
  gem install compass

Install stuff JS libs via bower
  bower install

Now you can:
* grunt test
* grunt server
